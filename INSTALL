REQUIREMENTS

A Linux distribution. Pluto has been tested on x86 and x86-64 machines 
running Fedora Core, Ubuntu, and RedHat  Enterprise Server 
5.x. Solaris should also be fine if you have GNU utilities. In order to use 
the development version from Pluto's git repository, automatic build system 
tools including autoconf, automake, and libtool are needed. GMP (GNU multi 
precision arithmetic library) is needed by ISL (one of the included 
libraries). If it's not already on your system, it can be installed easily 
with, for eg., 'sudo yum -y install gmp gmp-devel' on a Fedora, or
'sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev' on an Ubuntu. 


QUICK INSTALL

$ tar zxvf pluto-0.11.3.tgz
$ cd pluto-0.11.3/
$ ./configure 
$ make

configure can be provided --with-isl-prefix=<isl install location> to 
build with another isl, otherwise the bundled isl is used.

* polycc is the script wrapper around src/pluto and all other components, 
and it is the one to run. libpluto.{so,a} can be found in src/.libs/ and can 
be installed at the installation prefix (/usr/local default) with 
'make install'. Please refer to the README for more details.

* --with-isl-prefix=<location> to compile and link with an already installed 
isl. By default, the version of isl bundled with Pluto will be used.
