	This patch provides Clan with the ability to pase, inside a SCoP,
	a construct of the form:
	#pragma live-out a, b, c

	a, b, c are variables that lives after the scop execution. They
	are dumped in the option tag of the scoplib:
	<live-out-vars>
	1 2 3
	</live-out-vars>

	This pragma is read by the array contraction pass of PoCC.

	* include/clan/scop.h,
	* source/parser.y,
	* source/scanner.l,
	* source/scop.c: Manage #pragma live-out.

2010-02-05  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <pouchet@cse.ohio-state.edu>
	This patch provides Clan with the ability to parse, inside a SCoP,
	a construct of the form:
	#pragma local-vars a,b,c,d

	a,b,c,d are variables which may or may not be encountered in the
	scop. Their variable id list is dumped in the option tag of the
	scoplib:
	<local-vars>
	1 2 3 4
	</local-vars>

	This pragma is used by the array compaction pass of PoCC, which
	requires a list of variables which lives only within the SCoP.

	* include/clan/macros.h,
	* include/clan/scop.h,
	* source/parser.y,
	* source/scanner.l,
	* source/scop.c: Manage #pragma local-vars. Fix a small bug in the
	parser for the parsing of affine expressions starting with '-'.

2010-01-29  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch fixes a bug when parsing iterators and parameters as
	read variables in the RHS of an expression. The fake_array trick
	has been made useless, parsing is clean now.

	* source/parser.y: Fix the grammar.

	* include/clan/symbol.h,
	* source/symbol.c: Add function clan_symbol_remove.

	* tests/unitary/assigniter.c.scop: Fix the old test.

	* tests/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.

2010-01-27  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>

	* source/parser.y: Revert previous patch to support type cast. It
	must be done in a robust and tested fashion, it was not the case.

2010-01-26  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch adds an experimental support of C type cast. For
	instance c = (double) (0);
	The casted value must be in parenthesis also, syntax as:
	c = (double) 0; are not supported.

	* source/parser.y: Support basic type cast in expressions.

2010-01-26  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>

	* source/scanner.l,
	* source/parser.y: Extend to support re-entrance of tiled
	code. Now the ceild and floord are supported (with special

2010-01-26  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>

	* source/parser.y: Reinitialize the symbol global variables at the
	start of the parsing process.

2009-10-20  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch adds the support of basic arithmetic
	expressions (numbers operations only) in function arguments, such
	as foo(1+2*(3/4),bar). More complex patterns such as foo(2 * bar) are
	not supported.

	* source/parser.y: Improve grammar to suport also basic arithmetic
	expressions as argument in a function call.
	* tests/unitary/functioncall2.c,
	* tests/unitary/functioncall2.c.scop: New. Associated unitary test
	files.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Update accordingly.

2009-10-20  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch improves the grammar by supporting fields and methods
	syntax, such as a.b, a->b as fields, and a.b() or a->b() as method
	calls. Getter/Setter syntax such as a->b() = 42 is not supported.

	* source/parser.y,
	* source/scanner.l: Modify the lexer and parser to support fields
	and objects-like syntax (id.id and id->id).
	* tests/unitary/object.c,
	* tests/unitary/object.c.scop,
	* tests/unitary/field.c,
	* tests/unitary/field.c.scop: New. Associated unitary test files.

2009-05-02  Louis-Noel Pouchet  <louis-noel.pouchet@inria.fr>
	This patch updates Clan to use the ScopLib. All "generic"
	functions on scop_t, statement_t, matrix_t and vector_t have been
	substituted by their version from the ScopLib.  Embed a version of
	the ScopLib, which is compiled by default if no option is
	given. To use another installed version of the ScopLib, use
	--disable-internal-scoplib [--with-scoplib=xxx].

	* source/parser.y: Fix the grammar to handle parenthesis around an
	identifier.

	* tests/unitary/parenthesis.c,
