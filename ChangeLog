version 0.9.0

  8cce20118b895b0ea538df65894fc7c85806d1c9
  See git history for a log of changes. Bug fixes, better data structuring, more
  modular. 


version 0.6.0 BETA

date: 2010-02-16

1. Switch to Cloog-isl (from Cloog-polylib). ISL (Author: Sven Verdoolaege) is 
   integer-aware for its polyhedral operations unlike polylib, and relies on
   different algorithms/machinery for its operations. Cloog with ISL 
   as backend leads to better code generation and code. (1) Generated code is of much 
   better quality (simpler bounds, simpler conditionals, shorter cleanup code, 
   no spurious integer empty domains), (2) no value overflows when handling 
   deep loop nests or large tile sizes, and (3) faster code generation 
   typically for complex cases (deep loop nests, complex transformations, 
   large tile sizes and with both L1 and L2 tiling). 

2. Pluto core bug fix (bounding function problem in certain cases)

3. Do not put any context on parameters by default (use --context 
for minimum value on parameters).

4. Bug fix in orthogonal subspace computation

5. Some new examples


version 0.5.1 BETA

date: 2010-02-09

1. Minor bug fix: Bug in generation of OpenMP pragma in some cases (when the first hyperplane
is a parallel scalar dimension)

2. Minor bug fix: Bug in setting tile sizes from 'tile.sizes' when a permutable band
contains a scalar dimension. No tile size should have been read for the 
scalar dimension. 

3. Orio bug fix for unroll-jamming non-rectangular code

4. Minor inscop fix

5. Pluto core bug fix (bounding function problem in certain cases)

6. Support for privatization: thanks to Louis-Noel Pouchet; almost 
everything is done in Candl

7. Do not put any context on parameters by default (use --context 
for minimum value on parameters).

8. Option --nofuse now behaves correctly: distributing at inner levels too

9. Minor bug fix in orthogonal subspace computation


version 0.5.0 BETA

date: 2010-05-02

1. New polyhedral frontend and dependence tester (Clan/Candl) integrated. 
All LooPo components are out of Pluto now. Thanks to Clan, affine 
conditionals are now handled, besides pure function calls (assumed to be 
pure). Speed of the tool has also increased with this due to a much faster 
dependence tester. Use #pragma scop and #pragma endscop to demarcate 
portions to be extracted and optimized. Parameters are automatically 
detected. /* pluto start <parameter list> */ /* pluto end */ are no longer 
needed or supported.

2. Command-line options can now be specified at any position, before or after 
the file name

3. --indent option to indent output code

4. Several minor bug fixes

version 0.4.2 BETA

date: 2009-03-18

* Minor bug fixes

version 0.4.1 BETA

date: 2008-11-30

* Build issues on Mac OS X resolved

* Moved to Piplib 1.3.7

* Support for Bee+Cl@k tool with option --bee. Pragmas are inserted that the
Bee tool can handle and optimize for storage.

version 0.4.0 BETA

date: 2008-09-10

* Computation of transformations is much faster now (up to 7x in some cases)
due to optimizations in building the formulation, and better memory
allocation.  SPECFP2000 swim code can be transformed (end-to-end) in 11s
instead of 41s with transformation computation time reduced to 2.8s from
31.8s.

* Band detection for tiling now more advanced (dependences satisfied at
scalar dimensions are skipped to allow identifying tilable bands across scalar
dimensions: the scalar dimension is not preserved when the band is tiled. See
test/matmul-seq.c or test/doitgen.c tiling for example

* Transformed iterator names changed to t0, t1, t2, ... from c1, c2,  ..

* Transformed iterator names are indexed 0 to <num-1> instead of <1> to <num>

* Added plutune script that just steps through the command-line space of Pluto
and runs each version of the code: can be used to figure out the best set of
command-line options for a code. Just run with "./plutune <source.c>"

* Some register tiling bugs fixed (affected a few cases)


version 0.3.0 BETA

date: 2008-07-09

* GCC's preprocessor is now run on the Cloog code to replace statement text

* Ability to complete partially specified transformations through a '.precut' 
file. User can himself specify a .precut file if a particular custom fusion 
structure or a partial transformation should be used to start from. Pluto can 
then complete it; also, allows integration with the Letsee tool which can 
enumerate .precut files.

* Inscop fixed so that includes are not inserted as part of the optimized
program section but at the top of the file (Thanks to Piotr and Louis-Noël)

* Bug in computing SCCs fixed

* Bugs in register tiling fixed

* Changes to --maxfuse and --smartfuse

* Unroll and unroll-jam factor can be set with --ufactor=<factor>; 8 is the
default

* Code cleanup (less worse now)


version 0.2.0 BETA

* Added --smartfuse option (this is the default), --nofuse and --maxfuse 
are the other two

* Added 'install'. Installation can now be done with './install'

* Fixed compilation on 32-bit systems due to libpolylib64.a not being built

* PipLib, PolyLib, and Cloog are now included. No need to download or install
them separately

* Fusion algorithm implementation for the general case is now complete (but
still not tuned). Custom fusion structures can be forced with the .fst file

* --nofuse option now to treat all SCCs separately (no fusion across SCCs even
if it is possible)

* Changes to LooPo's C++ sources to make everything compile with GCC 4.3.0

* Lots of other minor fixes


version 0.1.0 BETA

First release
