OVERVIEW

PLUTO is an automatic parallelization tool that is based on the 
polyhedral model. The Polyhedral model is a geometrical representation 
for programs that utilizes machinery from Linear Algebra and Linear 
Programming for analysis and high-level transformations. Pluto 
transforms C programs from source to source for coarse-grained 
parallelism and locality simultaneously. The core transformation 
framework mainly works by finding affine transformations for efficient 
tiling and fusion, but not limited to it. OpenMP parallel code for 
multicores can be automatically generated from sequential C program 
sections. Pluto currently lacks intra-tile interchange (supposed to be 
done post-transformation) for spatial locality, prefetching, etc.. This 
will be implemented in future.

This is the chain of the entire source-to-source system that polycc will  
run. 

C code --> Polyhedral extraction -->  Dependence analysis
           (libclan)                    (libcandl)

-->    Pluto transformer
      (Core framework, automatic transformation)

 --> CLooG       -->  Pluto post-processing        -->           C 
   (libcloog)    (ploog, plorc, vloog, Orio)  
               (OpenMP pragma insertion, annotation-driven unrolling,
                  pre-vectorization)

Using PLUTO

- Use '#pragma scop' and '#pragma endscop' around the section of code 
  you want to parallelize/optimize.

- Then, just run 
    
    ./polycc <C source file> --parallel --tile

The following describe the kind of code you can put '#pragma scop' and 
'#pragma endscop' around, though the polyhedral model is not restricted 
to these. Most of the time, even though your program may not satisfy 
these, it may be possible to workaround these. These are all supported 
by the Clan frontend used by Pluto.

1. All accesses should be to arrays or scalars, and accesses to arrays 
   should be linear combinations of outer loop variables and other 
   parameters that are not modified within that portion.

2. All 'if' conditionals' conditions should be affine functions of outer 
   loop variables and parameters that are not modified in the SCoP.

3. All function call are assumed to be pure. 

4. Ternary operator '?' is supported. 

	var = condition? x: y;

	Single depth dynamic or data-dependent 'if' conditionals can be 
	rewritten using these, and will seamlessly be extracted.

5. All loop bounds should be affine functions of outer loop variables 
   and parameters that are not modified in the SCoP.

COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS

    --help 
    List all available options with one-line summary

    --tile [--l2tile]
    Tile code; in addition, --l2tile will tile once more for the L2 
    cache. By default, both of them are disabled. Tile sizes can be 
    forced if needed from a file 'tile.sizes' (see below), otherwise, 
    tile sizes are set automatically using a rough heuristic. Tiling 
    also allows extraction of coarse-grained pipelined parallelism with 
    the Pluto model.

    --parallel [--multipipe]
    Parallelize code with OpenMP (usually useful when used with --tile) 

    --parallelize
    Same as --parallel

    --multipipe 
    Will enable extraction of multiple degrees of parallelism (upto 2 as 
    of now). Disabled by default. By default, only one degree of outer 
    parallelism or coarse-grained pipelined parallelism is extracted if 
    it exists. In this case, the generated file will have a ".par2d.c" 
    suffixed to the basename of the input program.

    --smartfuse [default]
    This is the default fusion heuristic. Will try to fuse between SCCs 
    of the same dimensionality. 

    --nofuse
    Separate all strongly-connected components in the dependence graphs 
    to start with, i.e., no fusion across SCCs, and at any level inside.

    --maxfuse 
    This is geared towards maximal fusion (but not actually maximal 
    fusion). Fusion is done across SCCs.

    --[no]unroll
    Automatically identify and unroll-jam up to two loops. Not enabled 
    by default.

    --ufactor=<n>
    Unroll or unroll-jam factor (default is 8). Note that if two loops
    are unroll-jammed, you will get an nxn body

    --[no]prevector
    Perform post-transformations to make the code amenable to 
    vectorization. Enabled by default.

    --rar
    Consider RAR dependences for optimization (increases running time by 
    a little). Disabled by default

    --debug
    Verbose information to give some insights into the algorithm.  
    Intermediate files are not deleted (like the program-readable 
    statement domains, dependences, pretty-printed dependences, the 
    .cloog file, etc.). For the format of these files, refer doc/DOC.txt 
    for a pointer.

    --verbose
    Higher level of output. ILP formulation constraints are 
    pretty-printed out dependence-wise, along with solution hyperplanes 
    at each level. 

    --indent
    Indents generated code

    --version
    Print version number and exit

	-q | --silent
	UNIX-style silence: no output as long as everything goes fine

    Besides these, 'tile.sizes' and '.fst' files allow the user to force 
    certain things. See doc/DOC.txt for these.

    Other options will only make sense to power users. See comments in 
    src/pluto.h for details.


SPECIFYING CUSTOM TILE SIZES THROUGH 'TILE.SIZES'

Use a file tile.sizes in your current working directory if you want to 
manually specify tile sizes.  First specify L1 tile sizes, then L2:L1 
tile size ratios.  See examples/matmul/tile.sizes for an example. If 
8x128x8 is the L1 tile size, and 128x256x128 L2, the tile.sizes file 
will be

# L1 tile size 8x128x8
8
128
8
# L2 is 16*8 x 2*128 x 16*8
16
2
16


SPECIFYING A CUSTOM FUSION STRUCTURE THROUGH '.fst' or '.precut' file

One can force a particular fusion structure in two ways: either using 
the .fst file or the .precut file. In either case, the file has to be in 
your `present working directory'.  If both files exist in the directory 
polycc is run from, '.fst' takes precedence.

Alternative 1 (.fst file)

A component is a subset of statements. Components are disjoint, and the
union of all components is the set of all statements. So the set of all
statements is partitioned into components. Here's the format of the .fst 
file:

<number of components>
# description of 1st component
<num of statements in component>
<ids of statements in first component - an id is b/w 0 and num_stmts-1>
<whether to tile this component -- 0 for no, 1 or more for yes>
# description of 2nd component
...

See examples/gemver/.fst as an example; here is the meaning of a sample 
.fst for examples/gemver/gemver.c:

3 # number of components
1 # number of statements in first component
0 # statement id's of statements in 1st component (id is from 0 to   num_stmts-1): so we have S0 here
0 # don't tile this component {S0}
2 # number of statements in second component
1 2  # stmts in this component are S1 and S2
256 # tile this component {S1,S2}
1 # number of statements in the third component
3 # stmt id 3, i.e., S3 
0 # don't tile this {S3}

So, the above asks Pluto to distribute the statements at the outer
level as: {S0}, {S1,S2}, {S3}. It'll try to fuse as much as possible 
within each component if you use --maxfuse along with the above .fst, 
but will always respect the distribution specified.

Alternative 2

Using the '.precut' file

The '.precut' can be used to specify any partial transformation that 
Pluto can then complete. The format is as follows:

<number of statements>
<number of levels to tile>
# first statement
<number of rows, and number of columns for the partial transformation>
<rows of the partial transformation in cloog-like scattering function 
format; so if the partial transformation is c1 = i+j+1 for a 2-d 
statement and 1 program parameter, the row would like 0 1 1 0 1, the 
first number is always a zero (for an equality), then 1 for i, 1 for j, 
0 for the parameter, 1 for the constant part>
<a number that's not currently meaningful, just specify anything>
<whether or not to tile each of the levels, 0 for `don't tile', any 
other number for tiling>
# second statement
....

Parsing of any other text (like comments) in .fst or .precut is not 
handled.


MORE ON POST-PROCESSING

--prevector will cause bounds of the loop to be vectorized replaced by 
scalars and insert the ivdep and 'vector always' pragmas to allow 
vectorization with ICC. GCC does not support these, and its 
vectorization capalibility is currently very limited.


LOOKING AT THE TRANSFORMATION

Transformations are pretty-printed. The transformation is a 
multi-dimensional affine function on a per-statement basis.


LOOKING AT THE GENERATED CODE

The best options for taking a good look at the generated code are:

<pluto_dir>/polycc source.c --noprevector --tile --parallel

or 

<pluto_dir>/polycc source.c --noprevector 

to just look at the transformation without the actual tiling and 
parallelization performed; the transformation is just applied, and loop 
fusion can be seen.
